This Python project automates the organization of files in a directory by sorting them into categorized folders based on their file types (e.g., images, documents, videos, etc.). When executed, the script scans a specified folder, detects file extensions, and moves the files into corresponding subfolders. It helps maintain a clutter-free workspace by streamlining the sorting process, making it especially useful for downloads or shared directories. The project can be customized to include new categories or handle specific extensions based on user needs.
